## What is R?

* Language for statistical computing tasks
* Free and open source software <b>environment</b>
* Different <b>"command-line interaction"</b> paradigm
* Widely supported
* Follws latest trends in industry and academia

---
## R is a simple programming paradigm
* Command-Line Interface
  * Pipe-based statistics (command-line statistisc)
* Almost no-programming background is required
* Language is similar to proprietery <b>S</b> and <b>S-plus</b>

---
## R is robust and widely supported
* Academia
  * Academia pushs lates updates as pacakges
  * Statistically heavy tasks
* Industry:
  * Idustry is very motivated in hiring R-spcialist
* Volunteers and enthusiasts 
  * contribues in community
  * Writing articles, blogs, answering questions

--- 
## Latest trends in R
* Up-to-date developers tools
* Ability to parallelize statistical workload
* Web based IDE version of RStudio


---
## Integration with other tools
* Can be easily integrated with other tools
* Unix-way of performing tasks
  * Open-source
  * Comman-Line based interaction
* Example of integration: <b>SAP HANA</b>
  * What is SAP HANA?
  * Where SAP HANA is moving now
  * How R language and SAP HANA integrates
